MODEL SELECTION RATIONALE
================================================================================

SELECTION CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary Metric: Test Set Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Rationale: MSE directly measures prediction accuracy on unseen data,
           which is critical for real-world deployment.

COMPARISON RESULTS

SELECTED MODEL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Model: Random Forest
Test MSE: 31.5636
Test R²: 0.8869
Test RMSE: 5.6182

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vs Linear Regression: 67.03% MSE reduction
vs Decision Tree: 56.65% MSE reduction

RATIONALE FOR SELECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Random Forest was selected as the best model for the following reasons:

1. LOWEST PREDICTION ERROR
   - Achieved the lowest test MSE (31.5636)
   - Highest R² score (0.8869), explaining 88.7% of variance

2. ENSEMBLE LEARNING ADVANTAGES
   - Combines predictions from 300 decision trees
   - Reduces overfitting through averaging
   - Captures complex non-linear relationships

3. ROBUST TO OUTLIERS
   - Tree-based methods are less sensitive to outliers
   - Important for real-world medical data with variability

4. FEATURE IMPORTANCE INSIGHTS
   - Provides interpretable feature importance scores
   - Helps identify key factors affecting adherence

5. GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE
   - Train-Test R² gap: 0.0955
   - Minimal overfitting indicates good generalization

DATASET CHARACTERISTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dataset Size: 1431 records
Number of Features: 8
Features: age, num_medications, medication_complexity, days_since_start, missed_doses_last_week, snooze_frequency, chronic_conditions, previous_adherence_rate
Target Variable: adherence_rate (continuous, 0-100%)

The medication adherence dataset contains patient demographics,
medication complexity, and behavioral patterns. The selected model
effectively captures the relationships between these factors and
adherence rates, making it suitable for deployment in the MedMind
prediction API.

DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Random Forest model is recommended for deployment because:
- It achieves the best predictive performance on unseen data
- It generalizes well to new patients
- It provides actionable insights for healthcare providers
- It meets the accuracy requirements for clinical decision support
